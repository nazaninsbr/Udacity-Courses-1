using markdown makes readmes that are easier to scan 

markdown syntax:
	
	Markdown is a light markup language often used for READMEs

	Make it Bold:
		surround it with double asterisks:

			**wonderful**

	Make it Italic:
		surround it with underscores

			_did you see the cat?_

	Code, and not regular word:

			`strong`

	Title:

		## this is an h2
		### this is and h3


	List item:
		* list item


	Link:
		[here](the url)

	Code:
		
		```
			write it here
			skljd
			alkdjf
		```		

	Note that HTML is still valid in Markdown


	markdown has the extension
			.md
	you can not just open a file, you need to use something like "Dillinger"
