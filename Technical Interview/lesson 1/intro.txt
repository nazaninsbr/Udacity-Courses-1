Efficieny:

	also called complexity

	how well you are using your resources 

	measured in time and space 


Notation:

	we will calculate efficieny using the big O notation 

	O(n) --> n represents the size of the input to the function 


Worst Case:
	
	1. the static part of the big O is not important

		O(2n+4)  === O(2n)

	2. we care about the worst possible situation
