Lists:
	a group of things with an order

	the order doesnt mean much and we could just keep adding things to the end 


Linked List:

	characterised by its links 

	they dont know how long the list is or what an specific element is 



Array Vs. Linked list:
	
	1. they both store some value

	2. in array they store the index in themself too

		however in a linked list you store the next element 



Stack:
	
	list based data structure

	the main idea is: you keep elements on top

		you can get the top element easily 

		LIFO

		useful when:

		- you care about the order they were added 
		- yo ucare about the element on top

		pop()
		push()


Queue:

	FIFO

	the oldest element (the first element) = head

	dequeue -> you remove the head element 

	the newest element (the last element) = tail

	enqueue -> you remove the tail element 


	peak -> you just see the head but dont remove it 


	priority queue = you remove the highest priority element first 

	if the priorities are the same, you remove the head (the oldest element)
