How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	well for one companies all expect you to be able to work with Git
	on the other hand if you suddenly make a mistake and delete everything you can just go back to the older version you have and not everything is lost


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?


	you might forget to make a commit and then later on not remember what the change that you made was or it would be too late to go back to the previous working version if you suddenly face a bug after changing a code for days and not commiting but you dont have the previous working version
