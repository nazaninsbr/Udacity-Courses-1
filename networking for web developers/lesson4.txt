TCP flags

	SYN (synchronize) [S] — This packet is opening a new TCP session and contains a new initial sequence number.

	FIN (finish) [F] — This packet is used to close a TCP session normally. The sender is saying that they are finished sending, but they can still receive data from the other endpoint.

	PSH (push) [P] — This packet is the end of a chunk of application data, such as an HTTP request.

	RST (reset) [R] — This packet is a TCP error message; the sender has a problem and wants to reset (abandon) the session.

	ACK (acknowledge) [.] — This packet acknowledges that its sender has received data from the other endpoint. Almost every packet except the first SYN will have the ACK flag set.

	URG (urgent) [U] — This packet contains data that needs to be delivered to the application out-of-order. Not used in HTTP or most other current applications.
