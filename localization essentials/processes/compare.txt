Reviewers - Reviewers are the first to look at and review the content. They are usually part of the staff of an LSP.

Language Manager - Large organizations like Google sometimes have roles called “Language Managers” or “Language Specialists”. Whereas the reviewer is attached to a specific project and is usually contracted by Google through an LSP, the Language Manager is part of Google and is an expert in a particular language at Google. Unlike reviewers, Language Managers play a role in localization quality from start to finish. They decide on product names, terminology and the style guide before a product is sent to localization. They oversee translation for a particular language. Then, when review starts, they interact with reviewers by overseeing all reviewer work during the localization process for their particular language.

QA - QA occurs after Reviewers and Language Managers have done their job. It is the final testing before the product goes out the door. It is different from what the reviewers and Language Managers do because the focus is on the complete product and not just the words that went through translation. QA is the check that once everything comes together - the localized design, the localized engineering, the translated text - does the product make sense? At Google, this is done internally, but other companies may contract out for their QAing.
