Internationalization:

	process of generalizing a product to handle multiple languages and cultural conventions. it happens during software development 



they prepare it so it is language and reigon independent 


Steps:
	- desing and engineering 

		a flexible product 
		and pay attention to some parts of the UI like:
			* density and fonts 
			* layout 
				like dont write text in images 
			* colors 
				they can have different meanings in different cultures 
			* spacing 
				character limit or ...
			* message description
			* dates, currencies, units, addresses and phone numbers 
			* plurals and genders 
				programming tool kits 

	- testing 

		Psuedolocalization:
