Localization project management tool is used to schedule localization tasks, monitor progress and control costs at a higher level.

Translation management tools give information about a translation project, such as the number of words and translation memory matches but not about the overall progress of multiple localization tasks in multiple languages.

Translation Memory management tools are for Translation Memories - which are databases of already translated terms. Translation memories are used to aid in translation. They do not give information about the completeness of a specific translation.

Terminology Management Tools are used to create, manage and share with translators glossaries for specific localization projects. They do not give information about the completeness of a specific translation.
