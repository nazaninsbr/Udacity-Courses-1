The git log command is extremely powerful, and you can use it to discover a lot about a repository. But it can be especially helpful to discover information about a repository that you're collaborating on with others. You can use git log to:

group commits by author with git shortlog
  $ git shortlog
filter commits with the --author flag

  $ git log --author="Richard Kalehoff"
filter commits using the --grep flag

  $ git log --grep="border radius issue in Safari"
